To make the code more modular and maintainable, yes, breaking it into multiple files is a good idea—especially as we add more strategies, which could make a single `human_strategies.py` file bloated and hard to navigate. Since your goal is to generate extended sequences of solving steps (mimicking human logic) for each puzzle in the dataset, organizing by strategy type or complexity will help keep related functions together and make it easier to extend (e.g., adding new strategies without touching unrelated code).

### Suggested File Names and Structure
Based on the taxonomy below, I recommend grouping strategies logically by their complexity and type of operation. This aligns with common Sudoku solver implementations, where simpler strategies (like singles) are applied first in the solver loop for efficiency, before escalating to more complex ones (like chains). Here's a breakdown:

- **singles.py**: For basic single-candidate strategies (Naked Single and Hidden Single). These are the simplest and most frequent, resulting in direct certainties (filling a cell).
- **subsets.py**: For pair/triplet/quad strategies (Naked Pair/Triplet/Quad and Hidden Pair/Triplet/Quad). These operate on small groups (2-4) of cells or candidates, often leading to eliminations.
- **intersections.py**: For Locked Candidates (also known as Pointing Pairs/Triples or Claiming). This focuses on intersections between units, leading to eliminations.
- **fish.py**: For grid-pattern strategies like X-Wing and Swordfish (extendable to Jellyfish if needed). These are column/row-based eliminations on larger patterns.
- **wings.py**: For hinge/chain starter strategies like XY-Wing and XYZ-Wing. These introduce simple chain logic for eliminations.
- **chains.py**: For advanced chain-based strategies (Coloring, Forcing Chain, Nishio). These are more complex, often involving graph-like traversals or trials, and can lead to either certainties or eliminations.

This gives us 6 files instead of 2, but they're small and focused—better for scalability. If you prefer just two files to start, we could do `basic_strategies.py` (singles + intersections + subsets) and `advanced_strategies.py` (fish + wings + chains), but the finer split will pay off as we implement more.

Each file would contain:
- The strategy functions (e.g., `find_naked_singles(candidates, all_deductions)`).
- Possibly sub-functions if needed (e.g., separate row/col/box handlers for hidden subsets).

Then, create a central `strategies.py` file that:
- Imports all the strategy functions from the above files.
- Maintains the `STRATEGY_FUNCTIONS` dictionary (mapping names to functions).
- Handles group expansions (e.g., `'hidden_single'` → row/col/box variants).
- Exports `find_deductions_batch` (which computes candidates once, then calls the requested strategies).

This way, your solver can import from `strategies.py` without knowing the internal file split.

### Outline of the Whole Repo
Here's how the repo could look and work together. The flow is: Download/process data → Load puzzles by difficulty → For each puzzle, run a solver loop that applies strategies step-by-step, recording each deduction/elimination as part of a "sequence" (e.g., a list of states or steps) → Save or analyze the sequences.

├── solver.py               # The core solver: Loads .npy files, for each puzzle: initialize grid, loop until solved/stuck: compute candidates → find deductions (via strategies.py) → apply fills/eliminations → record step (e.g., as a dict: {'step': i, 'grid_state': copy_of_grid, 'deductions': list_of_dicts}). Handles batching for efficiency. Outputs sequences as .npy or JSON per difficulty.

```

**How It Works Together**:
1. Run `dataset_download.py` (once): Fetches data, buckets by difficulty into `data/`.
2. In `main.py`: Parse args (e.g., difficulties to process), load inputs/outputs from .npy.
3. Call functions from `solver.py`: For a batch of puzzles (e.g., all level 5), initialize grids from inputs.
4. Solver loop per puzzle (or batched where possible):
   - While not solved and progress possible:
     - Call `find_deductions_batch` from `strategies.py` with desired strategies (e.g., start with basics, escalate if stuck).
     - Apply deductions: Fill certainties first, then eliminations. Update grid.
     - Record the step: Current grid snapshot + list of deductions applied.
   - Validate against output (solution) if needed.
   - Collect sequences (lists of steps) for ML dataset generation.
5. Save sequences (e.g., per difficulty as .npy: array of [puzzle_id, step_id, grid_flat, deductions_json]).

This structure supports your "extended sequence" goal: Each sequence is a chain of states from initial grid to solved, with human-like steps annotated by strategy type.

### Taxonomy of Strategies
Sudoku strategies can be classified in a few ways, but no single taxonomy is perfect—they overlap. I'll break them down by:
- **Action Type**: Does it result in a *certainty* (definite fill of a cell) or an *operation on unknowns* (eliminate candidates, reducing possibilities without filling)?
- **Complexity/Size**: Based on the number of cells/candidates involved (single=1, double/pair=2, triple=3, quad=4, or more for chains).
- **Scope**: Unit-based (row/col/box), intersection (between units), pattern/grid-wide, or chain/trial (implications across the grid).
- **Notes**: Brief description, why it's "human-like," and typical order in solvers (simpler first to avoid unnecessary complexity).

| Strategy              | Action Type          | Complexity/Size | Scope              | Notes |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Naked Single**     | Certainty (fill cell) | Single (1 candidate in cell) | Cell-only | Simplest: Cell has only 1 possible candidate left after basic eliminations. Applied first in most solvers. |
| **Hidden Single**    | Certainty (fill cell) | Single (1 cell for a candidate in unit) | Unit (row/col/box) | Candidate appears in only 1 cell in a unit; fill it. Similar to naked but "hidden" among other candidates. |
| **Locked Candidates** | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Pair/Triple (2-3 cells in intersection) | Intersection (box-row/col) | Candidate locked to a box-line intersection; eliminate from rest of line or box. AKA Pointing (box→line) or Claiming (line→box). |
| **Naked Pair/Triplet/Quad** | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Pair (2), Triple (3), Quad (4) cells/candidates | Unit (row/col/box) | Group of cells in unit with exactly those candidates; eliminate them from other cells in unit. |
| **Hidden Pair/Triplet/Quad** | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Pair (2), Triple (3), Quad (4) candidates/cells | Unit (row/col/box) | Group of candidates appear only in those cells in unit; eliminate other candidates from those cells. Inverse of naked subsets. |
| **XY-Wing**          | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Triple (3 cells in chain) | Chain (bivalue cells connected) | Pivot cell (XY) linked to two wings (XZ, YZ); eliminates Z where wings "see" it. Simple chain strategy. |
| **XYZ-Wing**         | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Triple (3 cells, pivot has 3 candidates) | Chain (trivalue pivot + bivalue wings) | Extension of XY-Wing; pivot (XYZ) + wings (XZ, YZ); eliminates Z in common peer cells. |
| **X-Wing**           | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | Quad (4 cells in rectangle) | Grid-wide (2 rows + 2 cols) | Candidate in 2 rows only at 2 cols each, forming rectangle; eliminate from those cols elsewhere. Basic "fish" pattern. |
| **Swordfish**        | Operation on unknowns (eliminate candidates) | 9 cells (3x3 grid) | Grid-wide (3 rows + 3 cols) | Like X-Wing but for 3 rows/cols; eliminates in aligned cols/rows. Advanced fish. |
| **Coloring**         | Operation on unknowns (eliminate) or certainty (if contradiction) | Variable (chain length) | Chain (candidate graph) | Treat candidates as graph nodes, color chains; if same color sees each other, eliminate. Handles complex implications. |
| **Forcing Chain**    | Operation on unknowns (eliminate) or certainty (fill if all paths lead to same) | Variable (chain length) | Chain (implications across grid) | Follow "if A then B then C" chains; if contradiction or forced value, act. Can be short (nice loops) or long. |
| **Nishio**           | Operation on unknowns (eliminate via trial) | Variable (assumption + chain) | Trial/chain (assume candidate true/false) | Assume a candidate is true, propagate; if contradiction, eliminate it. Lightweight backtracking/trial-and-error. |

**Overall Patterns**:
- **Certainty vs. Unknowns**: Singles always fill (certainty). Most others eliminate (reducing unknowns), which may indirectly create new singles. Chains/trials can do both.
- **Single/Double/Triple**: Singles are "single," subsets scale to quad, wings/fish are fixed-size patterns (triple/quad+), chains are variable (often >3).
- **Human-Like Progression**: Humans start with singles (obvious fills), then subsets/intersections (local patterns), then fish/wings (grid scans), and chains/trials last (deductive reasoning). Your solver should apply in this order to generate natural sequences.
- **Implementation Tip**: All rely on candidates array. Simpler ones (singles/subsets) are unit-based and fast; chains are slower (graph traversal), so apply sparingly.
