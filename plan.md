# Status of Strategy Implementation

The solver now supports singles, subsets, basic intersection techniques, fish strategies (X-Wing and Swordfish), and wing strategies (XY-Wing and XYZ-Wing). The elimination handler has been implemented to support immediate candidate updates from advanced strategies. The chains.py file still contains only placeholder comments, meaning chain techniques (Coloring, Forcing Chain, and Nishio) are not yet implemented.

# Plan to Complete Remaining Strategies

## Implement remaining strategy family

- Chain strategies (chains.py): Implement Coloring, Forcing Chain, and Nishio to capture implication-based eliminations or forced fills. Use the existing elimination handler to propagate effects from these chain-based deductions.

## Integrate and register

- Ensure the newly implemented fish and wing strategies are added to `STRATEGY_FUNCTIONS` in `strategies/strategies.py`.
- Expand the default strategy list in `solver.py` to include fish and wing strategies now that they are stable.
- Once chain strategies are implemented, add them to `STRATEGY_FUNCTIONS` and the default strategy list as well.

## Testing & validation

- Create small puzzle sets or unit tests that specifically exercise the new fish and wing strategies, in addition to the existing ones.
- Develop tests for chain strategies once implemented.
- Confirm that eliminations and fills from all strategies (including the new ones) are correct, improve overall solver progress, and do not introduce conflicts.
- Validate that the elimination handler correctly propagates changes across strategies for more complex puzzles.

Following this updated roadmap will complete the solverâ€™s planned strategy suite, enabling comprehensive human-style deduction sequences for even the hardest puzzles.
